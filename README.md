# Branch Note
This branch keeps track of a point when the system was working with jax.

It uses dense matrices, which are much less efficient, but many of the older
tests were run using jax, and the pytorch version is not really 100% complete.

Maybe this should be implemented as a tag, but I might return to it and make
some changes to it still if I want to go back for some reason. And the pytorch
branch is stable enough now that I think it can be considered main.
